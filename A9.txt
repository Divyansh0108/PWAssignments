1. an array is a collection of same type of elements place in a contiguous memory locations that can be accessed individually by referring or using to their index number.
2. in java, array can be declared like:- 
<datatype> <variable name> [] 
or
<dataype> []<variable name>;
3. No, we cant change the size of array at runtime
4. Yes, we can declare an array without assigning its size, which can be manually performed later.
5. Default values of array in case of various datatypes is as follows:
boolean: false
int: 0
double: 0.0
String: null
char: unicode (\0000)
6. 1-d array is the simplest form of array in which the elements are arranged linearly.
 example:- int a[] = {1,2,4,57,834}
7. the program is as follows:

public class numbers
{
public static void main(String []args)
{
int num[][] ={ 
           {1,2,4,6,3},
           {11,22,44,66,33},
           {111,222,444,666,333};
          };
for(int a[] = num)
{
for(int b = a)
{
System.out.println(b);
}
}
}
