1)
Map in java is collection which stores data as key-value pairs, in which values can be duplicate but the keys are unique.

2)
These are:- Hashmap, treemap, linkedhashmap

3)
Hashmap is unordered collection whereas treemap is sorted collection 

4)
we can check using containsKey() or get(). First one returns boolean values where as get method returns the value which that key is associated with

5)
Generics are used to provide type safety in java with the collections such as arraylist etc. The type is often written in the :_ <>

6)
some of the benefits are:-
reusable code
type safety
improved performance

7)
generic class in java can work with different types of data and makes the process typesafe

8)
type parameter in java generics is used as a holder for type of data used by the generic class. example:= <T> or <N>

9)
generic method can work with different types of data just like generic class.

10)
ArrayList is non generic but ArrayList<T> is generic. second one provides the type safey but the first one does not.
second one can store only one type of elements but first one can store any type of element.
