1.To create an object in java, we use the new keyword. <classname> <object name> = new <classname>()
2. New is a java keyword that is used to create an object and allocate memory for it in the heap. 
3. there are 3 types of variables in java, namely, instance, local, static.
4. instance variables are initialised outside the functions, in the class, local variables are declared inside a particular function in which it has to work. Function scope is the scope for local variables whereas instance variables can be used throughout the class.
5. for local variables, memory area is allocated in stack, whereas for the instance variable, memory is allocated inside the heap.
6. Method overloading is a technique used to reduce the complexity of the java program by using the same function name with different number or type of parameters.
